HOW-TO GUIDE

The code itself is relatively simple, as explained in the report. The code should work when the appropriate electrical components are connected as per the diagrams in the report. Once the power supply is connected to the Arduino UNO R3 board and the code is deployed, the robot should climb the tree and return back to base autonomously while displaying the readings from the two sensors in the Serial Monitor.
